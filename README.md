# DOM Partner Lab

## Description
You will pair program with a partner to complete this assignemnt. One partner, the driver, should share their screen and be the one typing. The other partner, the observer, should review each line of code. Both partners should be cooperating when solving problems. When an objective has been met, the driver should push the code to the GitHub account, the observer should pull the changes, and the two partners switch roles. 

Please read all three steps before starting each Part and plan your code accordingly. 

## Part One

1. Using DOM, display all team members' names in a list.
2. Prompt the user to enter `ordered` or `unordered` and display the team members' names in an ordered or unordered list respectively. 
3. Create a button that launches the prompt when clicked.

## Part Two

1. Using the DOM, display the numbers 1 -100 inside a paragraph.
2. Create a button that displays the numbers when pressed.
3. Create a text input. When the button is clicked, it should display from 1 to the number the user entered

## Part Three

1. Using DOM, create a button that, when clicked, changes the back background color of the webpage to `cyan`.
2. Modify the button's functionality to toggle between `cyan` and  `salmon`
3. Replace the button with a dropdown of color options. When the user selects a color, the background should change to the selected color.

***Happy Hacking!***
