# DOM Partner Lab

## Description
You will pair program with a partner to complete this assignemnt. One partner, the driver, should share their screen and be the one typing. The other partner, the observer, should review each line of code. Both partners should be cooperating when solving problems. When an objective has been met, the driver should push the code to the GitHub account, the observer should pull the changes, and the two partners switch roles. 

Please read all three steps before starting each Part and plan your code accordingly. 

## Part One

1. Using DOM, display all team members' names in a list.
2. Prompt the user to enter `Small` or `Large` and size the team's logo respectively. `Small` should be 400 x 250 while `Large` should be 800 x 500. 
3. Prompt the user for a color and set the background to the color they enter.
4. Gather the team member names through a series of prompts.

## Part Two

1. Prompt the user for their name and create a header the say's `<user's name>'s Resume!` eg. `Kaleb's Resume!`. You should use the DOM to create a new element, not to update an existing element.
2. Create an array of skills in your JS file. Prompt the user to enter `ordered` or `unordered` and display the user's skills in an ordered or unordered list respectively. 
3. Prompt the user for a number and remove that skill from their list of skills.

## Part Three

1. Using DOM, create a button that, when clicked, changes the back background color of the webpage to `cyan`.
2. Modify the button's functionality to toggle the background between `cyan` and `salmon`
3. Add a text input. When the user clicks the button, the background color should change to the color the user entered in the input.

***Happy Hacking!***
